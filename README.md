# React based Searchable Product List

This is a basic product list built in pure react and can be filtered using the search bar which will narrow the list down by name or the check box which will remove items that are not in stock. 

This uses a static state hard coded in the App.js file. Future versions will use redux to make the state be in one place and get to grips with the basics of redux.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
